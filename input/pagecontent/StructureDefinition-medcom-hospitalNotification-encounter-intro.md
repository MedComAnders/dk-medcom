### Scope and usage 
This profile is used as the Encounter resource for the MedCom HospitalNotification message. The MedComHospitalNotificationMessageEncounter contains (beside references as shown below) identifier and code for sending notification messages.  
The HospitalNotificationEncounter profile for HospitalNotification is narrowed down because of danish legislation. The HospitalNotification message is sent without patient acceptance and only a very limited data set is allowed to be transmitted by danish law.
